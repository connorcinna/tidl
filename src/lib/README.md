Rust bindings for accessing the (currently) experimental Tidal API.

Requirements:

Client ID and client secret stored in a .env file in your root application directory.

The client ID and client secret are used for basic authentication to retrieve a bearer token from Tidal, which will then be used for any actual requests.
